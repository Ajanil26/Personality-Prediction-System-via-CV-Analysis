## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python (backend), HTML, CSS, JavaScript (web interface)
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Flask (web development), Pandas (data handling), NLTK (NLP), Google GenerativeAI (AI interaction)
- **Tools**: PyPDF2, textract, docx (text extraction from resumes)

## Implementation Details

### Resume Processing and Trait Assignment
- Extracts textual data from resumes using PyPDF2, textract, and docx.
- Preprocesses text by removing punctuation, tokenization, and lemmatization using NLTK.
- Assigns personality traits based on extracted skills and predefined associations from 'traits.txt'.

### Web Interface and User Interaction
- Implements a Flask-based web application to facilitate resume uploads and display analysis results.
- Renders HTML templates ('index.html' and 'result.html') for user interaction and results visualization.

### AI Interaction for Trait Description
- Utilizes Google's GenerativeAI to describe a candidate's personality based on assigned traits.
- Constructs queries to the AI model to generate descriptive insights about personality traits.

### Data Management and History
- Stores extracted resume details in a CSV file ('extracted_details.csv') for historical reference.
- Allows users to view history, export data, and clear history via the web application.

## Objective and Use Cases

The Personality Prediction System streamlines candidate evaluation by providing insights into personality traits derived from resumes or textual data.

### Use Cases

- **Recruitment Agencies**: Automates personality analysis to simplify candidate evaluation.
- **HR Departments**: Screens job applicants efficiently by analyzing personality traits.
- **Employers/Managers**: Helps in selecting candidates who fit company culture and job requirements.

## Conclusion

The Personality Prediction System is a powerful tool that integrates machine learning, NLP, and AI technologies to enhance the hiring process. By automating personality assessment and leveraging AI-driven insights, it enables recruiters and employers to make well-informed hiring decisions.
